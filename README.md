# Pak - A Simple Text-Based File Archiver

**Version: 1.1.1**

## Abstract

`pak` is a command-line utility written in Bash designed to bundle multiple files and directories into a single, human-readable text archive (`.pak` file). It stores basic metadata (path, size, line count) for each file and provides commands to pack, list the contents of, and unpack these archives. Its primary characteristic is its text-based format, making archives potentially inspectable and manageable with standard text tools.

## Introduction

This script provides a straightforward way to combine several files into one package. Unlike binary formats like `.tar` or `.zip`, `pak` archives are plain text files. This can be useful in environments where only text processing is desired or allowed, for simple bundling tasks, or for embedding assets directly within other text-based systems. The script includes logic to automatically exclude common development artifacts and hidden files/directories.

## Rationale

Why create another archiver when tools like `tar` exist?

1.  **Simplicity & Transparency:** The archive format is plain text, using clear markers. You can open a `.pak` file in a text editor and understand its structure easily.
2.  **Text-Centric Workflows:** Ideal for scenarios where binary blobs are undesirable or difficult to handle, such as embedding configuration files or small scripts within larger text documents or source code.
3.  **Educational Tool:** Serves as a practical example of shell scripting, file manipulation, text processing (`awk`, `find`), and state management within a script.
4.  **Built-in Filtering:** Automatically excludes common temporary/residual files and directories (like `.git`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `.pak` files themselves) to keep archives clean without complex exclude flags.
5.  **No External Binary Dependencies (beyond coreutils):** Relies on standard Unix/Linux command-line tools (`bash`, `find`, `stat`, `wc`, `cat`, `awk`, `mkdir`, `dirname`, `basename`), which are typically available on most systems.

## Full Explication: How It Works

### Archive Format

A `.pak` archive generated by this script is structured as a sequence of file entries. Each entry follows this pattern:

```

**PAK\_FILE\_START**
Path: relative/path/to/your/file.txt
Size: \<file size in bytes\>
Lines: \<number of lines in file\>
**PAK\_DATA\_START**
\<Content of file line 1\>
\<Content of file line 2\>
...
\<Content of file last line\>
**PAK\_DATA\_END**

````

-   `__PAK_FILE_START__`: Marks the beginning of a new file entry.
-   `Path:`, `Size:`, `Lines:`: Store metadata for the file.
-   `__PAK_DATA_START__`: Marks the beginning of the actual file content.
-   `__PAK_DATA_END__`: Marks the end of the file content.

### Packing (`--pack` or default)

1.  The script iterates through the files and directories provided as arguments.
2.  If an argument is a file, it checks against the exclusion rules (see below). If allowed, it gathers metadata (`stat`, `wc`) and calls `pack_file`.
3.  If an argument is a directory, it uses `find` to locate all files recursively within that directory.
4.  `find` is specifically configured to:
    * Prune (skip entirely) directories named `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `python`, `*.dist-info`, `venv`, `.venv`, or `htmlcov`.
    * Exclude files ending in `.pak`.
    * Exclude files named `poetry.lock`.
    * Exclude any file or directory whose path contains a component starting with a dot (`.`) (e.g., `.git/config`, `src/.hidden_file`).
5.  For each valid file found, `pack_file` is called.
6.  `pack_file` function:
    * Prints the `__PAK_FILE_START__` marker.
    * Prints the metadata lines (`Path:`, `Size:`, `Lines:`).
    * Prints the `__PAK_DATA_START__` marker.
    * Uses `cat` to append the file's content.
    * Prints the `__PAK_DATA_END__` marker.
7.  All output is sent to standard output, allowing redirection (`>`) to create the `.pak` archive file.

### Listing (`--ls`)

1.  Takes an archive file path as input.
2.  Uses `awk` to process the archive file line by line.
3.  `awk` looks for the `__PAK_FILE_START__` marker to identify the start of an entry's metadata.
4.  It extracts the `Path`, `Size`, and `Lines` values from the corresponding metadata lines.
5.  When it encounters `__PAK_DATA_START__`, it prints the collected metadata for that file (Path, Size, Lines, tab-separated).
6.  It ignores the actual file content between `__PAK_DATA_START__` and `__PAK_DATA_END__`.

### Unpacking (`--unpack`)

1.  Takes an archive file path as input.
2.  Reads the archive line by line using a `while read` loop in Bash.
3.  Maintains state using variables (`current_file`, `in_data`).
4.  Uses a `case` statement to react to markers:
    * `__PAK_FILE_START__`: Resets `current_file`.
    * `Path:*`: Extracts the file path and stores it in `current_file`.
    * `__PAK_DATA_START__`: Creates the necessary parent directories (`mkdir -p`) for `current_file`, truncates (or creates) the target file (`:` > `$current_file`), and sets `in_data=1` to indicate that subsequent lines are file content.
    * `__PAK_DATA_END__`: Sets `in_data=0` to stop writing content.
    * Any other line: If `in_data` is 1, the line is appended (`>>`) to the `current_file`.

### Exclusions

The script deliberately excludes certain files and directories during packing:

* **Files:**
    * Any file ending with `.pak`.
    * Any file named exactly `poetry.lock`.
    * Any file whose name starts with a dot (`.`).
* **Directories (and their contents):**
    * Any directory whose name starts with a dot (`.`).
    * Directories specifically named `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `python`, `*.dist-info`, `venv`, `.venv`, or `htmlcov`.

## Installation

1.  Download the `pak` script (or clone the repository).
2.  Make it executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x pak
    ```
3.  (Optional) Move it to a directory in your `$PATH`, like `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`, for system-wide access:
    ```bash
    mv pak /usr/local/bin/
    ```

## Usage

The script operates in several modes:

**1. Pack Files/Directories (Default Mode):**

Bundles specified files and directories into an archive printed to standard output.

```bash
# Syntax
pak [--pack] <file_or_dir_1> [file_or_dir_2 ...] > archive_name.pak

# Examples
# Pack a single file
pak my_script.sh > script_archive.pak

# Pack multiple files
pak file1.txt config.yaml > bundle.pak

# Pack the contents of a directory (excluding ignored items)
pak ./my_project > project_backup.pak

# Pack multiple items
pak main.py utils/ helpers/ README.md > app_code.pak
````

*Note: Use redirection (`>`) to save the output to a file.*

**2. List Archive Contents:**

Displays the metadata (Path, Size, Lines) of files stored within a `.pak` archive.

```bash
# Syntax
pak --ls <archive_file.pak>

# Example
pak --ls project_backup.pak
```

Output might look like:

```
my_project/main.py      1024    50
my_project/utils.py     2048    100
my_project/data.txt     512     15
```

**3. Unpack Archive:**

Extracts files and directories from a `.pak` archive into the current directory, recreating the original structure.

```bash
# Syntax
pak --unpack <archive_file.pak>

# Example
pak --unpack project_backup.pak
```

*This will recreate `my_project/main.py`, `my_project/utils.py`, etc., in the current directory.*

**4. Show Version:**

Displays the script's version.

```bash
# Syntax
pak --version

# Example
pak --version
```

Output:

```
pak version 1.1.1
```

## Limitations

  * **Text-Only Focus:** Primarily designed for text files. While it can technically store binary files, the text-based processing (especially `wc -l` and line-by-line reading/writing) is inefficient and may corrupt binary data if it contains newline characters interpreted by the shell's `read` command.
  * **Metadata:** Only stores path, size (in bytes), and line count. It does *not* preserve permissions, ownership, or timestamps.
  * **Efficiency:** Less efficient than binary formats like `tar` for large files or large numbers of files due to the overhead of markers and text processing.
  * **Error Handling:** Basic error handling (e.g., file not found) is present, but complex scenarios (e.g., disk full during unpack, corrupted archive format) might lead to unexpected behavior.
  * **Filename Constraints:** While generally robust, filenames containing unusual characters (especially newlines, though `IFS= read -r` helps mitigate this during packing) could potentially cause issues, particularly during unpacking.
  * **Tool Dependency:** Relies on specific outputs/behaviors of `stat`, `wc`, `find`, `awk`. While common, variations between systems (e.g., BSD vs. GNU coreutils) might require minor adjustments.
